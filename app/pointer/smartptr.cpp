/**
 * A Smart Pointer is a wrapper class over a pointer with an operator like * and -> overloaded.
 * The objects of the smart pointer class look like normal pointers.
 * But, unlike Normal Pointers, it can deallocate and free destroyed object memory.
 *
 * 1.Itâ€™s a pointer-wrapping stack-allocated object. Smart pointers,
 * in plain terms, are classes that wrap a pointer, or scoped pointers.
 * 2.It destroys itself when it goes out of its scope
 * 3.Smart pointers are more efficient as they have an additional feature of memory management.
 * 4.They are automatic/pre-programmed in nature.
