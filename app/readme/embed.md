1. Esp32 controller
2. Arduino controller
3. Raspberry-pi controller


## Project idea

1. Smart home automation
It can be turn on a fan when it reaches temperature in a room,
or controlling an entire heating system or turn off light.

2. Digital  clock
Learning about timer, real time, or controller seven segment display,
or LED matrix display.

3. Weather station:
with sensors wit humidity sensors, and
try to measure air speed, air pressure or
build distribued embedded system with multiple  microcontrollers, outdoors to measure outdoor temperaure and
outdoor humidity one in your living room an one in your bed room ,with multiple  microcontrollers talk to
each other via protocal

4. Plants
Build an automatic plants watering system that measuring the humidity of the soil and it giving you a reminder
whenever your plants need water or whether  that is eating Heaven a small water tank or already hooked up to your
watering system so that you can automatically watering your plants.

5. Advanced project
Build Autonomous robots are great they combine multiple sensors very nice algorithmic challenges
Build Fleet of Autonomous cars that are driving around 
Build a samrt traffic management system that is managing a traffic of autonomous cars'
or traffic light that is detcting how many cars are already in line and it has communcation between the cars
and your traffic management system.

6. Flying
Build Autonomous drone 

7. Embedded operating system
Build Embedded operating system that schedule tasks in certain time frames,
or to amuch more complete operating system with tasks handling priority switching memory management
