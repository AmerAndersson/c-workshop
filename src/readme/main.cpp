/**
 * @brief A program to solve a simple problem for a Bookstore
 * Our store keeps a file of transactions, each of which records the sale of one or
 * more copies of a single book. Each transaction contains three data elements:
 * * 0-201-70353-X 4 24.99
 * The first element is an ISBN (International Standard Book Number, a unique book
 * identifier), the second is the number of copies sold, and the last is the price at which
 * each of these copies was sold. From time to time, the bookstore owner reads this
 * file and for each book computes the number of copies sold, the total revenue from
 * that book, and the average sales price.
 * * 1. Define variables
 * * 2. Do input and output
 * * 3. se a data structure to hold the data
 * * 4. est whether two records have the same ISBN
 * * 5. Contain a loop that will process every record in the transaction file
 * Weâ€™ll start by reviewing how to solve these subproblems in C++ and then write our bookstore program.
 * @author: Amer Andersson
 * @return 0 when program execution completes successfully.
